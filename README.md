# DS Assignment - Lamport's Logical Clock Implementation


This repository contains the implementation of **Lamport's Logical Clock** as part of the Distributed Systems (DS) assignment. The assignment explores two approaches to constructing a Lamport's Logical Clock: one with hardcoded inputs and another that allows user input for dynamic message communication.

## Repository Contents

- **`First_Approach.py`**  
  This program demonstrates the first approach to implementing Lamport's Logical Clock. The process communication (sending and receiving of messages) is hardcoded, and the logical clock values are computed accordingly.  

- **`Second_Approach.py`**  
  This program demonstrates the second approach to implementing Lamport's Logical Clock. It accepts user inputs to define the message communication dynamically, providing more flexibility for testing various scenarios.
